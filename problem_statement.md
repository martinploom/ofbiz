# Backend not working with proxy inside docker container

The repository is https://github.com/martinploom/ofbiz and branch is feature/marketdata_backend.

The branch has working backend which runs on local PC running the command `./gradlew cleanAll loadAll ofbiz` which can be used via https://localhost:8443/ordermgr

Next I build the docker image from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) using command 

`docker build -t back .`

After that I create and run the container using the command

`docker run -dit --name back -p 8443:8443 back`

After waiting some minutes I can access the https://localhost:8443/ordermgr

Also, the Postman POST https://localhost:8443/api/auth/v1/login for authentication works and GET https://localhost:8443/api/generic/v1/entities requests with JWT token works.

Activating reverse proxy which is running in local PC, not in the container with the following conf (this conf works with Ofbiz running without container when the [aurelia front marketdata_develop branch](https://github.com/martinploom/ofbiz-ui/tree/marketdata_develop) is launced with `au run` and they can communicate with each other so login and data requests work):

After activating the reverse proxy I can still login to backend using https://localhost:8443/ordermgr in the browser and the Postman requests still work nicely.
When trying to access the back via proxy http://localhost/api/ordermgr it says **404 Not found** ...

The Postman POST requests against http://localhost/api/auth/v1/login works, and I get token back and GET also works for http://localhost/api/generic/v1/entities

Running the frontend with `au run` without Docker container, I can log in and everything works nicely.

The problem currently with Postman POST and GET requests was, that I used http://localhost/api/api/auth/v1/login which had one `/api` too much.

Now, that locally the back in container and front with `au run` is working with the proxy configuration mentioned above, I will try putting the front in container as well.

The front used is [here](https://github.com/martinploom/ofbiz-ui/tree/marketdata_develop) under branch marketdata_develop and the this is the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/martinploom/ofbiz-ui/blob/marketdata_develop/Dockerfile) and the [NGINX proxy conf](https://github.com/martinploom/ofbiz-ui/blob/marketdata_develop/deploy/nginx/default.conf) is here that is used inside the frontend container, so the proxy is running inside the container.

Building the frontend Docker image

`docker build -t front .`

Then I run the container

`docker run -dit --name front -p 80:80 front`

After that I can access the front from browser via http://localhost (the proxy inside container is running), but when trying to log in I get **502 Bad Gateway** when inspecting chrome Network requests. The https://localhost:8443/ordermgr still works in browser. But the Postman POST method for login to http://localhost/api/auth/v1/login with same settings as before does not work anymore.

Will try connecting the containers into one network and see what happens then. 

Creating the network

`docker network create mynetwork`

Adding front and back to it

`docker network connect mynetwork back`

`docker network connect mynetwork front`

After that I still get **502 Bad Gateway** when trying to access back via proxy with Postman POST login request.

When I go into back container with

`docker exec -it back /bin/sh`

Install curl

`apt install curl`

And try to ping frontend container

`curl http://front`

I receive the front HTML raw data.

When going into front container with 

`docker exec -it front /bin/sh`

Adding curl to front container
`apk add curl`

And trying to ping back

`curl https://back:8443/ordermgr`

I get that there is SSL cert problem, so I run the same command with `-k` flag

`curl -k https://back:8443/api/generic/v1/entities` 

I get the following response

`{"statusCode":401,"statusDescription":"Unauthorized","errorMessage":"Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid or absent Authorization header"}`

Which is to be expected as there is no login header. So the back can be accessed from front container as well it seems.

Running command 

`nginx -t`

to check which conf file is used by NGINX in front container and the response is following:
`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

Going to the file

`cd /etc/nginx/`

and installing nano

`apk add nano`

and going into it with `nano nginx.conf` I do not see the server conf, although the `default.conf` should be imported. Changed the `https://localhost:8443` to `https://back:8443` and restarted the nginx with `nginx -s reload` and then I got response from the back via Postman POST login method ... and the stuff works in browser as well.

So all in all, if this works in server, the possible solutious were
`https://back:8443` instead of `https://back:8443/` which I think I tried out before as Tavo suggested, but in [here](https://medium.com/@codingwithmanny/create-an-nginx-reverse-proxy-with-docker-a1c0aa9078f1) it was said that back proxy must have the final `/` for sure.

Currently, not sure why the proxy inside container brakes stuff, 
1. is it because the 6060 port is swapped to 80 port, 
1. or proxy settings have changed (due to using html in folder not 6060 port?)
1. or running proxy inside container brakes it (seems most logical, as we are having problems with back and it is not related to 80 vs 6060 port)

What I would try
1. take the proxy out of front container and run it in server (can I do it? How does it find index page?)
